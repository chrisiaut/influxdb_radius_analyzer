# InfluxDB RADIUS Analyzer

![Example grafana log](https://www.pictshare.net/800/22ca68ad0e.jpg)

Compatible with all versions of InfluxDB since it uses UDP and the line protocol.

## Updating
You can update by copying the whole script but make sure to check the first lines of analyze_influx.php for (new) settings since the settings will be overwritten after each update because for now I'm too lazy to proper implement the config in an external file, sorry.
